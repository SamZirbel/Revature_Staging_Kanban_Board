# Revature Staging Kanban Board : Samuel Zirbel

### Hello! - I will be using this Repository for my Revature Kanban board

I also feel like I should explain how I am using the Project Board feature

I am using issues as cards within the board - issues can then be opened and closed - so when I am switching between task I open and close them

- The project board activity shows the status of newly added and moved cards but clicking on a card and then the issue's name will open up the issue's page where details surrounding the times it was opened and closed also appear
