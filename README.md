# Revature Staging Kanban Board : Samuel Zirbel

### Hello! - I will be using this Repository for my Revature Kanban board

I also feel like I should explain how I am using the Project Board feature

I am using issues as cards within the board - issues can then be opened and closed - so when I am switching between task I open and close them

- The project board activity shows the status of newly added and moved cards but clicking on a card and then the issue's name will open up the issue's page where details surrounding the times it was opened and closed also appear

Today I officially began Project Onboarding.  After attending the regular staging stand-up I attended another initial Project Onboarding meeting where I learned about the expected participation in this phase.  I then went and reviewed the manual upon Revature Pro for PO activities.  Later I participated in a number of Codin' Game clash of code activities with one of my batch mates who is still in staging.  Through these activities I learned about the split() method which can turn a string into an array of strings.  This is useful because it is comparable to the array of characters which is obtainable through toCharArray().  Having another way to divide a string into characters within Java should help with future projects.  I also learned a cool way to compare anagrams quickly from doing this which I am excited to try out with Java.  The developer who used the solution created a character array, then sorted it, and then recombined it to compare the two string using the .equals() method which was really cool.  They were using Javascript so I will have to see if it translates over to Java, but there is a sort method that appears like it will work so I am hopeful.  After this I participated in two of the coding escape rooms on the Codin' Game platform, mostly with batchmates of mine also within Project Onboarding.
