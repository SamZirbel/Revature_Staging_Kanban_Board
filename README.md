# Revature Staging Kanban Board : Samuel Zirbel

### Hello! - I will be using this Repository for my Revature Kanban board

I also feel like I should explain how I am using the Project Board feature

I am using issues as cards within the board - issues can then be opened and closed - so when I am switching between task I open and close them

- The project board activity shows the status of newly added and moved cards but clicking on a card and then the issue's name will open up the issue's page where details surrounding the times it was opened and closed also appear

## PO Day 4 : Thursday : 12/23/2021

This day I participated in the Codin' Game challenge and completed the assigned PO weekly challenges.  I completed the Java Challenges and one of the JS challenges.  The JS challenge required the use of Node JS for use of an external input file so it was not technically part of my tech stack.  I ended the day participating in the Hot Seat interview where there seemed to be a misunderstanding by others within the breakout room that Data Query Language and Data Manipulation Language.  Both of these SQL subsets do contain Select which seemed to be unknown to the other PO individual I was paired with.

## PO Day 3 : Wednesday : 12/22/2021

This day I participated in the Codin' Game challenge and then worked on the assigned PO weekly challenges.  I also participated in the weekly HackerRank challenge where I had a bit of trouble with the second question and ended up solving it roughly 10 minutes after the challenge had ended.  My problem was that with the time complexity and once I changed my approch it worked on the first run.  I then ended the day studying Java enthuware for a bit.

## PO Day 2 : Tuesday : 12/21/2021

Today I participated in a few Codin' Game challenges.  Then I proceeded to start work on the weekly PO coding challenges with the Javascript Challenge.  The challenges would have been easy enough to complete with hard coded input but I wanted to set it up so that the input could be taken sequentially from an external file.  After searching around for a portion of the morning I ended up having to learn some Node JS in order to complete the problem which was interesting.  A lot of the tutorials would say to do certain things but in the end I had to fiddle around with the code to figure out what actually worked and was useful for that situation.  Following this I participated in the Kahoot Tournament after lunch.  Finally I studied the Enthuware Test 2 a bit.

## PO Day 1 : Monday : 12/20/2021

Today I officially began Project Onboarding.  After attending the regular staging stand-up I attended another initial Project Onboarding meeting where I learned about the expected participation in this phase.  I then went and reviewed the manual upon Revature Pro for PO activities.  Later I participated in a number of Codin' Game clash of code activities with one of my batch mates who is still in staging.  Through these activities I learned about the split() method which can turn a string into an array of strings.  This is useful because it is comparable to the array of characters which is obtainable through toCharArray().  Having another way to divide a string into characters within Java should help with future projects.  I also learned a cool way to compare anagrams quickly from doing this which I am excited to try out with Java.  The developer who used the solution created a character array, then sorted it, and then recombined it to compare the two string using the .equals() method which was really cool.  They were using Javascript so I will have to see if it translates over to Java, but there is a sort method that appears like it will work so I am hopeful.  After this I participated in two of the coding escape rooms on the Codin' Game platform, mostly with batchmates of mine also within Project Onboarding.
